# Text Based Lib

Text Based Lib is a python library to help coding text-based games.
This tiny but complete library has a lot of tiny functions for making games. There is no way to properly use TextBasedLib : everyone can use it like they want!

I hope this project will help you and I would enjoy if you contacted me to tell me about a cool feature to add !
